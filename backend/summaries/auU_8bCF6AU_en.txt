The speaker describes the enjoyable and jovial atmosphere on the set of Tarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah, particularly when working with Shyam Pathak (Popatlal), Champak Lal, and Bhide, who share a common dressing room.  Despite the lighthearted environment, the speaker maintains a respectful formality, using the honorific "aap" when addressing these colleagues.  The remainder of the transcript contains repetitive and uninformative filler words.
