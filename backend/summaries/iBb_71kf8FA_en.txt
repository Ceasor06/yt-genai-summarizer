Jithyalal received a call at 263248 from someone, potentially named Jani, inquiring about purchasing a 90-carat ruby. While Jithyalal confirmed the phone number was his, he stated he hadn't given it to Madhvi, who it seems was referred to his shop by another individual seeking a reputable Gujarati jeweler.
