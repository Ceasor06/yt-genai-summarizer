 Whether you're a big rally racing nerd with a sim set I could your living room or not, EA Sports WRC is a bundle of fun, allowing you to smack into trees and fidelity that was previously reserved for the pros. But just how much do you need to spend to have a satisfying sim racing experience? To find out, EA Sports handed us one metric bushel of sponsorship money and basically said, I don't know, do whatever you want, as long as you work in a few talking points about the game. So we decided to get the whole range of setups from a wheel and pedals that we got for $30 on Facebook Marketplace, hooked up to a PC that matches their minimum spec all the way up to a racing sim setup that costs more than an actual rally car. Is it worth it to spend a bit more cash on your ring or would you be better off sticking with a PS5 controller? Because, not gonna lie, that's looking like a very real possibility right now. Meet the thrust master T80 Ferrari Edition. Side note guys, you absolutely should not pay extra for the prancing pony logo. Just get an unbranded T80. We found this one for $30 on Facebook Marketplace, including some tasty feet picks. So that's the way you're gonna want to go if you're aiming at a pretty basic setup. Speaking of basic setup, getting this setup is very easy. You just throw the wheel at your tech-tippy friend and let him figure it out. Oh, interesting, and we're timing me. Excellent. And begin. To be clear, the point is not to set some kind of speed record for installing a racing wheel, but rather just to provide some convenience context for each of the various setups. All we gotta do for this guy is loosen the desk clamp without clamping this guy. I have personally done that before. Slide this bad boy on to here. Tighten and clamp the desk clamp. Oh boy. I kind of see leaving it plugged in, but just in a pile next to you. I suspect that's what a lot of people end up doing. But we're gonna go ahead and plug her in. Alex, was your genius plan to use this IKEA footrest to kind of angle the pedals or if I move it another way? That'll be horrible. Okay, fair enough. Hey, but how convenient is that? Now you don't need a footrest. Out. Dang it. Okay. I am really not selling this very well. Not the single most ergonomic. Okay, no with the chair adjustments. We're gonna need a little bit more time. There, that's not so bad. Under two minutes. Hold on, hold on. I'm racing something. What are you doing? You take them. Damn them. Into the wheels like that. That's my pro racing tip right there. Then you don't slide back. Oh yeah. Hey, that's not bad. It mostly stops. Two minutes 30 seconds just about on the nose. Let's fire up the game. We have a solution for the pedals. Uh oh, I guess I could just put them against the wall. Yeah, and we see that box that's filled with sandpaper. How do I always end up crawling around and doing your desk? That's only happened like once before. Here we go. If it's stupid and it works, it's not stupid. Okay, this is not bad. You've got your ABXY or at least the PlayStation equivalent. This engine start button is actually a little D-pad, which is super cool. Now that we're in the main menu, there's a whole whack of gameplay options, but we're just gonna jump straight into quick play where we can play solo or multiplayer in a variety of different modes. They've got quick generate, create rally, where you can create a custom one and a regularity rally, which I assume has something to do with the crap in yourself that you might do going over some of these jumps and stuff. Sorry, I'm not into rally racing, so I don't know all the lingo. And Alex, you say we want H1 for real drive? Yes. Why H1? What's H1? Yeah, that's historic the first. That means nothing to me. Okay, perfect. No, it just means like it's the very oldest. Oh, okay. Ooh, competition type, realistic. That's one of the things people are really excited about with this game. It's not super arcade-y, which is gonna be a problem for me. Oh my God, our poor car. It's left. Oh my God. Can you tell this wasn't our first take? Woo! Oh, no! Okay. Things didn't take long to go sideways, and not gonna lie, I don't think I can blame the game for it. In spite of the fact that we're running on minimum hardware, so this is a 9600K with a GTX 1060, I'm getting about 50 FPS running at 1080p low without dynamic resolution scaling. Overall, pretty smooth gaming experience. I can't say the same for my wheel, though. That doesn't mean somebody more skilled couldn't put up some decent times with this thing. Not everybody needs an expansive array of buttons and an Alcantara wrap. I mean, the shifting paddles are tactile enough, and you're certainly not gonna lose your grip on it. But it lacks any kind of force feedback, meaning that particularly for an inexperienced driver, not having any kind of feedback from the vehicle, you know, stirring a little harder when you're going faster or from the shape of the road, makes it really difficult to tell what the heck is going on, because all I have is the visual cues, which at that point raises the question, why don't I just use a controller? Let's try this for comparison. The controller definitely has the convenience factor going for it. There. Here, let me start my timer. 3.67 seconds. They got integration with the PS5's rumble. Oh, you're doing it. You're doing it. Don't worry about my door, man. You worry about your door, okay? I'm gonna blow up my engine, never mind my doors. Oh, boy. Um. I just need a little bit of time to get my hands. Really? You can tell? I mean, woo! Stuff still happens. Okay, hey, we made it around that corner. Second gear mind you, but we made it around the corner. Ram total adjustment time of about two minutes, and I'm pretty sure I'm better on this already. Oh! Don't speak too soon. That's how you learn. We know that this is not an Apple Stapples comparison. The price delta between this and that wheel is over double, but this at least serves other purposes and doesn't take up as much space in your house, and I think it's fair to say from our short experience that a wheel without force feedback is just plain not gonna be a good time. I mean, PS5 winner? Oh, buy a lot. I tested this on the shake down. I was 12 seconds faster on the controller. That's like 25% faster. Crazy. Yeah. Bottom line though, don't let us tell you what you like. At the cost of a basic wheel, second hand, you should just buy one. Try it. And then if you don't like it, resell it. Probably for the exact same amount you paid. It's my favorite kind of free rental. I did it all the time. Of course, the real reason that we did this video was not actually to look at the extremes both high and low budget, but rather so Alex could have me excused to build his personal mid-tier setup on work time. Wait, what? Yeah. Okay, that actually makes a lot of sense and explains why we're at your house for this shoot. Guys, been genuinely stoked for this game since it was announced that codemasters picked up the WRC IP and he's put together a pretty nice but not unreasonable rig for it, starting with the GT light pro from next level racing. Once again, in theory, we just crack this thing open and it's off to the races. I'm making it look so easy. You really, really are not. Oh. Oh, what? Why am I doing this? This is your job. Oh, right. Okay. I just rake the thing. Let's pinch market. Wait, you're gonna undo it now? Yeah, just for fun. But theoretically, once it's all set up, it would just be a matter of unfolding it and you're pretty much good to go. We're gonna want to run these cables first, including, I guess, power. Oh, this is cool. We've got some handy-dandy little 3D printed spacers here so we can clamp this onto a really, really slim plate like this. And then we've got a couple of screws to secure this in place. I don't know. I don't know. Am I allowed to have a helper friend? Yes. Oh, wow, they do. Oh, nice. You don't happen to have handy-dandy spacers for this boy, do you? I have screws for it. You have screws. Oh. Well, yes, that will do. There we go. There we go. Oh! What was that? So good. I don't know. By now, it should be pretty obvious that we're spending both a lot more time and a lot more money on this versus our last setup. When you consider the extra utility, not to mention how much you're already into it for by the time you've got a PC that will run this game at its best, I don't think it's that unreasonable. This seat, for example, the ET Racing Light is $300 new and you can get a less cushiony version for $50 less and you can find them for as little as $150 used if you're lucky. Other than that, we just need a USB and an HDMI cable to run over to our PC and we should be pretty much good to go. USB extension, anyone? Oh, hi. Perfect. If you don't need USB 3 speeds, active cables like this one are inexpensive and convenient way to extend the range beyond the official specification. As for what we're plugging it into, Meet Alex's G27. It's the same racing wheel. Logitech has been making for about 19 years, but the 2009 version of it that is not as good as the original one, but better than the ones that they have now. Yeah, how exactly does that work that they keep bringing out new ones that have less features and higher prices? Like the G920 doesn't even include a shifter anymore. The good news is that means you can get something old like this one, the G27, or even the G25 and still get a modern gaming experience out of it. This can be had for around the 150 to 250 US dollar range. By the way, we're not going to be running this stock. Alex, do you have some hair elastics, Andy? Oh, yes, one second. Of course he does. I need to go steal them. So we go around here with two, hold it up. Wait, don't you lift any brake? I'm a rally car. You go, psh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, that is really nice. Now we just need a display. Mounting for a monitor is not included with most of these seats because it's typical for people to set this up in their living room or their family room and use their TV. But as a not forever alone, Alex doesn't really have that option, which is funny because she thinks it's not going to disturb her, I guess, but like it's really loud. When the force feedback is running, it's like, eee, eee, eee, eee. Hey, who? Let's put this monitor on to this mount that you got from also next level racing and what are one of these worth? Ah, 100 bucks or so. It's going to be difficult. With the power of the LTT screwdriver, LTT screwdriver. Okay. How do we get the other ones in now? That's the bit that I was concerned about. Oh, like this. Well, okay. We can, oh, okay, and I'll seriously start. I bet we can, whooy! I think we can get this last one. Hold on. You want to, you might want to back it back that off. Yeah, that one's not going in. Nope. That's a negative. The other news is that it's not going to get lost because it's trapped in there. You got to have a seat though so we can get the height adjusted. Okay. Oh, good dish. Oh, good dish. I don't think you're supposed to get in from that side with the shift route. Oh, my mic's caught, too. Now I can't, oh, boy. Is this the right height for you, sir? I need to go up a little bit. But you want it that close to you? You want the wheel covering that much of the screen? Yeah, that's fine. Oh, I mean, I guess that's sort of the experience. The FLV is like the biggest thing. Right, okay. Not bad. You don't have Ed's racing shoes. That heel toe, I mean, probably could have been a little better if you weren't in moccasins. You stay put because I think getting in and out of there is not happening at this point. I'll get you set up, okay? I think we're supposed to like move this thing away. That's how you get in a note. I don't. Race cars are hard to get into. It's just realistic. Something to note, if you want to replicate Alex's setup, which by far is the best bang for the buck out of what we're looking at today. We'll have everything linked down below. The G27 specifically cooperates best with a USB 2 port. So this is a USB 3 extension, but he specifically chose this motherboard because it has USB 2 ports and we're operating in USB 2 mode. This is amazing. Why are you going out that side? That's great. Ah, yes. Being short. Not so bad after all, is it? This is the difference maker. While the other wheel had tension when you turn it to the side, this one has motors inside it that actively resist you, according to the bumps in the rotor, the force with which you should be turning. They're not the most sophisticated motors. You can get ones that are higher power or have better granularity, but I am expecting this to be a major step up. This is another critical piece of any sim setup. You do not want to do what he was doing or even what I was doing. Every time you need to keep order mouse, so having one of these magneted to the bottom of the chair is an A-player move. Is this the monitor you're going to be using or is this just something you still from work for now? This is my monitor. It's supposed to replace the one that's in there. It's better in every single way, but the OSD sucks, so I don't use it. Oh. It's really bad, like awful, just terrible. Wow, how often do you need to use the on-screen display? All the time, because you needed to be brighter during the day and then turn it down during the night, and then it was like, in the one right there, I have three color temperatures, three different color profiles. I don't believe you. Beautiful. You can switch between them. I just never. Oh. Let us know in the comments. Are you an Alex? Or are you a me? To Logitech's credit. Sure. They haven't developed a new wheel in 20 years, but hey, at least they're still supporting the old wheel that they still make. Yeah. Look at all these things we can adjust in the software. You got the force string, the degrees of rotation that it'll take before it just stops. It's great. Centering spring. Disable that. Also, degrees of rotation, 270 is the best for this. You can go full sim. I go full. I want to set records. People always get so mad. They're like, oh, it's not very realistic to do that. I'm like, I don't care. The most realistic thing is to try and win the race by exploiting the rules. We've gone a little higher end for the PC this time. Code Master recommends a 2070, but Alex has a 3080. So we're going to go ahead and crank some details, I think. This time we're also going to be upgrading the experience. We're going to go with WRC. And they've got 18 locations with gravel, snow, and tarmac that according to code masters is greatly improved. Alex wanted me to go with Chile. And this is a gravel map. Track. No. Stage. 34.7 kilometers. That is an incredibly huge map to create. No wonder this didn't launch on PlayStation 4. How could you even contain that? Not with easy, apparently. That's pretty cool. OK. Here, go to the left. Builder. Ooh. What are we doing? You're building a car? What do you mean? I don't know where engines go. Mid-engine. Yeah, sure. Oh my gosh. Exhaust kits? Like what? Why? What do you mean? Like just to change the sound? Oh. OK, well, this one then, I guess, right? Sure. I mean, yeah, brakes. I get the good one, I guess. Painite. I can feel the pain. Everyone watching this, who's actually into this stuff, including our sponsor. By the way, thank you very much. No, he knows the stuff. Andre knows it the most. He's just letting me struggle for fun. Am I done now? Oh my god. Andre is like, oh my god, is there so many things? This is also like kind of realistic, because they don't even make, like, they don't modify a Toyota Yaris. Right. They take a body and put Yaris body parts on it at the end. I see. That makes sense. This is like the tennis rackets that the pros supposedly use, when actually they just use their old racket that they trained on and learned on with a new paint job so they can sell the new racket to you, the idiot consumer, sort of. Does it matter how much I spent? I don't think so. Just quick play. Oh, it's automatic. Oh, well that's not going to be a very apples to apples comparison. Well, we can change that pretty easily. There we go. Oh no, I'm immediately much worse, Alex. Wait, where am I going? Oh, he said right. Okay, this must be very hard for you guys to watch. Ah, this is kind of the dirt slash WRC experience for the first couple of hours. They call it the dark souls of racing games. Okay. Did we say extreme left? I can't understand his accent. He sounds like an angel. Woo! Okay. That right there was the first like, oh yeah, I can definitely feel a difference with the first feedback. Oh, should you just left for braking? Ah, there's no way that I would be able to do that. That would completely break my brain. Oh no, speaking of breaking, oh yeah, oh yeah still alive. There is no question though that I am way faster on this than I was on either the other useless wheel with no feedback or the controller. You're on the road in a car that's so much harder to control. Oh yeah, this isn't even like apples to apples either. And this is a gravel track compared to the other one too, right? Yeah. Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh. Handbrake. Right, sorry, sorry, sorry, I just, I hit the thing. Oh no. I don't do it over steer line. No, no, I got this, I got this. Okay, show us how it's done. Oh god. I didn't even have fun on the other side to be honest with you. Oh yeah. Within a minute on having fun, totally different game. Oh my goodness. This is like scary fast. I would not want to be in this car. Oh, it's forced feedback needs to get changed a lot. Still, having it at all is so much better than what we had before, Alex. This is 1440p Ultra, we're sitting at about 80FPS and it's so much. Overall you beat me by 39. Well look, who's keeping track of the exact number? This is. I can do better than 136. All right, well, I can't do better than 136. Handbrake S. What, why do you need a handbrake in gas? So you can look over the handbrake. Yeah, unlike goodness. Oh, that poor engine. Well, that sounds like future Alex's problem. Oh yeah, we turned the force feedback way up and it is definitely better. Oh, I got this. I got this. Oh, no, no. Dang it. Okay, I'm still going to get a better time than last time. Oh crap. Oh no, am I? Okay, well that explains why the brakes aren't working very well. You're doing so much worse. I'm worse. Why am I worse than doorbell off? I love the damage effects though. No, no, no, I'm still alive. Okay, here we go. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Okay, well it's better than last time. Oh yeah. It's a pretty big improvement. This poor car. Let's see how she's doing. As great as this handbrake mod is here, I'd kind of like to continue to use as a shifter. So I got this thing. It was 80 bucks off of Amazon and it is the anix, sim racing handbrake. Anyway, let's throw it on. This handbrake came with hardware, but the slots aren't large enough for it to go through. Well, you got what you're paying for. Looks pretty funny. Oh, whatever you guys. Nice. That wasn't hard at all. Improvised some mounting hardware with some leftover basis screws. And you thought we were idiots for not putting all the screws in there. Once again. Wow. Honestly, this seems way worse. I think you just paid $80 for a downgrade, sir. Yeah, that feels so chunky and nice. This is chunky. Yeah, it's something. The good news is there are lots of other good upgrades that you can make to a setup like this if you want to spend a little bit more money. Like for example, a nicer pedal set from someone like Fan Attack. These can either stick to the floor with their grips or can be bolted into a frame or onto a sim rig. There's wheels. There might not be a huge control advantage to it, but I'd say having a wheel that's a similar diameter to an actual car might help it emerge a little bit. Yeah, there we go. That's more like it. And this particular one is attached to Fan Attack CSL DD, which is the same motor that we used in Jake's Intel Extreme Tech Upgrade. Oh. It costs almost as much as this, but it is a really, really nice upgrade. One that not everyone will agree about though is VR. The game is supposed to add VR support sometime in the ****, but Alex will not be using it. Nah, the whole sim racing is hard to set up is already a huge problem. You don't need to set up VR at the same time. It's shocking how often my valve hardware running on my valve software just miraculously doesn't work from one day to the next. You know what does work though? Is this transition to the ultimate setup? The ultimate sim racing setup that lives in our employee lounge hasn't changed since we built it. And that's because it was already flipping awesome. And codemasters has already done the work to integrate not just higher end peripherals from the likes of Fan Attack and Hoysingveld. Oh, these pedals, oh, these are tension. It's all adjustable and everything is so cool. But even D-Box, meaning that our platform down here which has four AC servomotors that can independently adjust the height of each corner of the platform, allowing it to tilt forward when you break, lean back when you accelerate, and bump all over the place when you're going over a gravel road. Fun fact, by the way, your code driver who sits in the passenger seat and calls out which turns are coming next how far out they are, recorded the lines while sitting in a rig like this so that as you're going down the road, his voice actually reflects the condition of the road you're driving out of it. That is so cool. Why am I talking about it then? Me and Lytis have both played around with this a fair bit in the game because honestly it's just absolute heaps of fun. Although that's not what we're going to be doing right now. This right here is going to be an emulation of the 1985 Safari Rally where all that Lytis needs to do for it to be historically accurate is to crash out. For the most part around like really long pavement stages and stuff like that, it's a lot of fun. The Safari Rally isn't. It's just a workout. It's punishing. It hurts you. What the heck? If it makes you feel any better, I got a 329 on the stage so it is quite doable actually. That's not to say I'm going to pull it off because apparently we've turned damage up to hardcore mode so good luck me. Hey, I had that too. Okay, should I do a shakedown? Yeah, do a shakedown, see how she feels. Okay. Two, one, go. Fifty. And I stole them. Fantastic. I am going really slow and this is extremely bumpy. Oh, redlined it. Oh, I'm in neutral. What's he days? Okay. I am not going very fast but it really feels like I am right now. And I was not paying attention to my co-driver. What do you say? I don't know, but I'm good. I'm still alive. Something that's hard to even focus on on, of course, like this because everything's shaking all over the place and you're just trying to stay on the road. Is that the game looks really, really good. We're on a 3090 here running at. What is it? Three by four K-allocks? Yes. This is freaking awesome. Woo! Oh my goodness, I hit a guy. There is no question whatsoever that the more feedback you can get into your body, the more realism you get. I can't believe what a polished state this is in for a game that isn't even out yet. Getting all of these exotic peripherals to work with anything can be a challenging at the best of times. How long did it take to set this up? Be honest. Probably about two hours. The hardest bit is that they don't have native triple monitor support. So I had to go into a config file and get that all done. You can see how it's kind of strange in the menu. Yeah, but the D-box stuff was all fine? Yeah, that just like worked. Oh, that's so cool. Okay, I'm ready to start. How do I do in my shakedown other than being slow? That was good. Slow is better than crashing out. Yeah. Alright, let's go. Let's go. What was your time? 326. And how much of it is the shakedown? I don't know, about a third of it. Okay, so I could be closer than I was yesterday. Yeah? Five. Oh, put it in first and give it full revs. Two. One. Go. Fifty. Oh my goodness. Well, that's not a good start. This is it. This is go time. We have to be left. Crap, crap, crap, crap, crap. I got to give her more gas. This is a really long gas pedal. Whoa, I do not need to give her more gas right now. Go slow. Slow is smart. No, no, I got this. I got this. It's not tightens over the crest. I got this. Go for it. No, I'm not flooring it, Andy. Go for it or go for it. Three right. Okay. Whoa, whoa buddy. How do I get in reverse? Dang it, I stole. Crap. Dang it, I stole it again. We won't count your penalties. There's penalties for resetting. Oh. Jump. Jump. Crest. Whoa! Man, if this gas pedal was a little shorter, I'd be having a way easier time with it. 30. Stop it. Whoa, what the hell? This is something? No! I can't not stall this thing. Okay. Doesn't help. I have to think about the lingo so much. I'm like depressed. Oh man, I am sweating right now. Bad bumps. Are you kidding me? Okay. That's a five minute 38. Five minutes 38? Well, let's see how you did with the penalties. Am I done? Oh shoot, I wasn't done. You're done. You just need to, it's the end of the rally, you know? You need to go up to the marshal. Did I just stall, I just stall just driving. In first, what the heck happened? Okay, just, just floor it. Let the clutch go and get up to the guy. This is not that hard. Okay, they did it for you. Okay. penalty. 17 seconds. Oh. How do you do that in three minutes something? I went a lot faster than that. Well, that felt really serious. Like, can you see? How's my pitch doing? There you go. We know the five minute race. No, no, the point is just like, okay. Wait, it's physically exhausting. Yeah. In a way that no other game is physically exhausting. Like, this is what I said. It's like grabbing on, like moving around. You get, even with the bolsters, you got to hold yourself to it. That was fun though. There's no way I could play for hours at a time though, man. That's crazy. Not that stage in this. No question in my mind. Sponsorship or not. That was a ton of fun. And if you're into rally racing, especially fun. But the best way to experience it. That's what we set out to answer. And my tier list goes a little something like this. Wheel without force. Bottom of the barrel. Terrible. Controller with any kind of vibration. Way above. Yeah, so much like this much above. And then literally anything with force feedback in a wheel. It's like, I don't know, that much higher. Yeah. And then I'd say it's more fun with the better wheel. But in terms of your capability to compete. Not that much. No. So you're happy with your setup? Oh yeah. I'm happy with that. I'm happy with that. Yeah. I think most people would be too. And EA would be really happy if we mentioned that EA Sports WRC is out now for Xbox Series X and S, PlayStation 5, and PC, with over 70 vehicles spanning decades of rally history. 17 locations with some of the longest stages we have ever seen in a rally game. And made by legendary developers, Code Master, so you guys are not going to want to miss it. There's a link in the description to pick up a copy of the game. And a bunch of the hardware that we showed off to help you guys best enjoy it. If you guys enjoyed this video, hey, maybe check out the one where we built this setup. Now that we've got this game for it, it's like without knowing it. This is what we made it for. It's so good. Awesome. This is what we made it for. It's so good. Awesome.
